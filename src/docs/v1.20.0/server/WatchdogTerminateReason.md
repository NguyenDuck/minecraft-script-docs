An enumeration with the reason that a watchdog is deciding to terminate execution of a behavior packs' script.

## Constants
### **hang**
`hang = "hang"`

Script runtime for a behavior pack is terminated due to non-responsiveness from script (a hang or infinite loop).
### **stackOverflow**
`stackOverflow = "stackOverflow"`

Script runtime for a behavior pack is terminated due to a stack overflow (a long, and potentially infinite) chain of function calls.
