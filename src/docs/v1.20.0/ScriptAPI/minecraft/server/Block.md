>[!IMPORTANT]
>These APIs are experimental as part of the Beta APIs experiment. As with all experiments, you may see changes in functionality in updated Minecraft versions. Check the Minecraft Changelog for details on any changes to Beta APIs. Where possible, this documentation reflects the latest updates to APIs in Minecraft beta versions.
Represents a block in a dimension. A block represents a unique X, Y, and Z within a dimension and get/sets the state of the block at that location. This type was significantly updated in version 1.17.10.21.
