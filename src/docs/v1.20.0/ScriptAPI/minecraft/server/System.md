## Methods
- [clearRun](#clearrun)
- [run](#run)
- [runInterval](#runinterval)
- [runTimeout](#runtimeout)

### **clearRun**
`
clearRun(runId: number): void
`

Cancels the execution of a function run that was previously scheduled via the `run` function.

#### **Parameters**
- **runId**: *number*

### **run**
`
run(callback: () => void): number
`

Runs a specified function at a future time. This is frequently used to implement delayed behaviors and game loops.

#### **Parameters**
- **callback**: () => *void*
  
  Function callback to run when the tickDelay time criteria is met.

#### **Returns** *number* - An opaque identifier that can be used with the `clearRun` function to cancel the execution of this run.

### **runInterval**
`
runInterval(callback: () => void, tickInterval?: number): number
`

Runs a set of code on an interval.

#### **Parameters**
- **callback**: () => *void*
  
  Functional code that will run when this interval occurs.
- **tickInterval**?: *number* = `null`
  
  An interval of every N ticks that the callback will be called upon.

#### **Returns** *number* - An opaque handle that can be used with the clearRun method to stop the run of this function on an interval.

### **runTimeout**
`
runTimeout(callback: () => void, tickDelay?: number): number
`

Runs a set of code at a future time specified by tickDelay.

#### **Parameters**
- **callback**: () => *void*
  
  Functional code that will run when this timeout occurs.
- **tickDelay**?: *number* = `null`
  
  Amount of time, in ticks, before the interval will be called.

#### **Returns** *number* - An opaque handle that can be used with the clearRun method to stop the run of this function on an interval.
