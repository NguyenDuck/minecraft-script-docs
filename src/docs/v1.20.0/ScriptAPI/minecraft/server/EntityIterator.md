This type is usable for iterating over a set of entities. This means it can be used in statements like for...of statements, Array.from(iterator), and more.

## Methods
- [[Symbol.iterator]](#[symbol.iterator])
- [next](#next)

### **[Symbol.iterator]**

`

#### **Returns** Iterator&lt;[*Entity*](Entity.md)&gt;

### **next**
`
next(): IteratorResult<Entity>
`

Retrieves the next item in this iteration. The resulting IteratorResult contains .done and .value properties which can be used to see the next Entity in the iteration.
