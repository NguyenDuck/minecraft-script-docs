### **teleport**
`

`

Teleports the selected entity to a new location

#### **Parameters**
- **location**: [*Vector3*](Vector3.md)
  
  New location for the entity.
- **teleportOptions**?: [*TeleportOptions*](TeleportOptions.md) = `null`
  
  Options regarding the teleport operation.

#### Examples
##### ***teleportMovement.ts***
```typescript
  const pig = overworld.spawnEntity("minecraft:pig", targetLocation);

  let inc = 1;
  let runId = mc.system.runInterval(() => {
    pig.teleport(
      { x: targetLocation.x + inc / 4, y: targetLocation.y + inc / 4, z: targetLocation.z + inc / 4 },
      {
        facingLocation: targetLocation,
      }
    );

    if (inc > 100) {
      mc.system.clearRun(runId);
    }
    inc++;
  }, 4);
```

### **triggerEvent**
`
triggerEvent(eventName: string): void
`

Triggers an entity type event. For every entity, a number of events are defined in an entities' definition for key entity behaviors; for example, creepers have a minecraft:start_exploding type event.

#### **Parameters**
- **eventName**: *string*
  
  Name of the entity type event to trigger. If a namespace is not specified, minecraft: is assumed.

#### Examples
##### ***triggerEvent.ts***
```typescript
  const creeper = overworld.spawnEntity("minecraft:creeper", targetLocation);

  creeper.triggerEvent("minecraft:start_exploding_forced");
```

### **tryTeleport**
`
tryTeleport(location: Vector3, teleportOptions?: TeleportOptions): boolean
`

Attempts to try a teleport, but may not complete the teleport operation (for example, if there are blocks at the destination.)

#### **Parameters**
- **location**: [*Vector3*](Vector3.md)
  
  Location to teleport the entity to.
- **teleportOptions**?: [*TeleportOptions*](TeleportOptions.md) = `null`
  
  Options regarding the teleport operation.

#### **Returns** *boolean* - Returns whether the teleport succeeded. This can fail if the destination chunk is unloaded or if the teleport would result in intersecting with blocks.
