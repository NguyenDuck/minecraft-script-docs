## Implements
- Iterator&lt;[*Player*](Player.md)&gt;

This type is usable for iterating over a set of players. This means it can be used in statements like for...of statements, Array.from(iterator), and more.

## Methods
- [[Symbol.iterator]](#[symbol.iterator])
- [next](#next)

### **[Symbol.iterator]**
`
[Symbol.iterator](): Iterator<Player>
`

#### **Returns** Iterator&lt;[*Player*](Player.md)&gt;

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This function can't be called in read-only mode.

### **next**
`
next(): IteratorResult<Player>
`

Retrieves the next item in this iteration. The resulting IteratorResult contains .done and .value properties which can be used to see the next Player in the iteration.

#### **Returns** IteratorResult&lt;[*Player*](Player.md)&gt;

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This function can't be called in read-only mode.
