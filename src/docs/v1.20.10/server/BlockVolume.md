# BlockVolume Interface
>[!IMPORTANT]
>These APIs are experimental as part of the Beta APIs experiment. As with all experiments, you may see changes in functionality in updated Minecraft versions. Check the Minecraft Changelog for details on any changes to Beta APIs. Where possible, this documentation reflects the latest updates to APIs in Minecraft beta versions.
> [!CAUTION]
> This interface is still in pre-release.  Its signature may change or it may be removed in future releases.

A BlockVolume is a simple interface to an object which represents a 3D rectangle of a given size (in blocks) at a world block location.

Note that these are not analogous to "min" and "max" values, in that the vector components are not guaranteed to be in any order.

In addition, these vector positions are not interchangeable with BlockLocation.

If you want to get this volume represented as range of of BlockLocations, you can use the getBoundingBox utility function.

This volume class will maintain the ordering of the corner indexes as initially set.

When manually editing these kinds of volumes, you need to maintain the identity of the corner as you edit - the BlockVolume utility functions do this.

Important to note that this measures block sizes (to/from) - a normal AABB (0,0,0) to (0,0,0) would traditionally be of size (0,0,0)

However, because we're measuring blocks - the size or span of a BlockVolume would actually be (1,1,1)


## Properties

### **from**
`from: Vector3;`

A world block location that represents a corner in a 3D rectangle

Type: [*Vector3*](Vector3.md)

### **to**
`to: Vector3;`

A world block location that represents the opposite corner in a 3D rectangle

Type: [*Vector3*](Vector3.md)
